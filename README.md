# Performing Arithmetic Using a Neural Network Trained on Images of Digit Permutation Pairs

This repository contains code to replicate the work described in the following paper: 

Marcus D. Bloice, Peter M. Roth, and Andreas Holzinger. "Performing Arithmetic Using a Neural Network Trained on Digit Permutation Pairs." In _International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems_, pp. 255â€“264. Springer, 2020. See <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59491-6_24>

The notebook allows the experiment `MNIST Final Experiments.ipynb` allows for the experiments to be replacated. 

Due to the random nature of the network initialisation, randomised train test splits, and so on, results may not match exactly what was presented in the paper.
